1.	aws_rds_refresh.sh was used to automate the most time consuming part of the non-prod environment refresh, I started the effort and reduced the time from 3 days to 2 days, after that my team reduced it to less than 5 hours. 
2.	Ngs_backup.sh – Oracle backup script rewritten as requested
3.	Neo4j – A very crucial system prone to outages without alerts, redesigned it bottom up, and reduced about 200 scripts to these small list of 10 scripts.
