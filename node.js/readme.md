My favorite pasttime activity is to learn something new, node.js is amazing, I am absolutely in love with it. But as always I start working on learning something new make some progress but have to drop it and pick up something else :). This is as far I went after completing a javascript training on Linked in Learning, my Linux Academy subscription doesnt really have anything useful for node.js development but pluralsight does seem to have 2 great courses. But would pick them up once I have something to work on so I can stick to it.
